  ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

  Security Vulnerabilities

  1. Authentication codes logged in plaintext - Major security risk
  2. Weak random generation - Using predictable time-based seeds instead of crypto/rand
  3. No TLS encryption - All data transmitted in plaintext
  4. Missing rate limiting - Vulnerable to brute force attacks

  Performance & Scalability Issues

  1. Inefficient database queries - GetByEmail() fetches ALL users then searches linearly
  2. Race conditions - Multiple concurrent requests can create duplicate users
  3. No database connection pooling - Will fail under load
  4. Missing database indexes - Code and CodeRefresh fields not indexed

  Architectural Problems

  1. Confused layer responsibilities - Controllers, services, and server layers overlap
  2. Massive code duplication - Same logic in 3 different places
  3. Poor separation of concerns - Business logic scattered across layers

  ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

  Data Model Issues

  1. Token model not persisted - No database table for tokens
  2. Missing proper relationships - No foreign keys or constraints
  3. Inconsistent error handling - Mix of error types and patterns

  Configuration Issues

  1. Environment variable inconsistencies - Mixed naming conventions
  2. Missing validation - No input sanitization in some endpoints
  3. No migration system - Schema changes not properly managed

  ðŸŸ¢ Positive Aspects

  - Passwordless authentication design is solid
  - JWT implementation is mostly correct
  - Good use of GORM for SQL injection protection
  - Proper role-based access control structure

  ðŸ“‹ Priority Action Items

  Week 1 (Critical)

  1. Remove authentication code logging from production
  2. Implement proper database queries (replace GetAll() patterns)
  3. Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
  4. Fix race conditions in login/refresh flows

  Week 2 (High Priority)

  1. Implement TLS encryption for gRPC
  2. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
  3. Replace weak random generation with crypto/rand
  4. Add proper database connection pooling

  Month 1 (Architectural)

  1. Consolidate duplicate code across layers
  2. Implement proper token persistence
  3. Add comprehensive error handling
  4. Create proper migration system

  The system shows promise as a backend authentication service but needs significant security and performance
   improvements before production use. The architectural issues, while not immediately critical, will make
  maintenance and scaling increasingly difficult over time.
